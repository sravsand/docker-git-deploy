Docker Git Deploy [![Docker Automated buil](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/pocesar/docker-git-deploy.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pocesar/docker-git-deploy/)
================

Dockerized Git deploy through SSH service, built on top of [official Ubuntu](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) trusty image. It uses git 'post-receive' hook and provides nice colored logs for each pushed commit.

Accepts an `IN`, `BRANCH_*`, `USER` and `PUBLIC_KEY` settings through environment variables, if the git history doesn't matter to you, pass only the `BRANCH_*` and `PUBLIC_KEY` settings, which aren't optional

This Dockerized image doesn't allow plain text logins, can only connect to it through the use of a public RSA key.

## Defaults

```
BRANCH_* = "" # [REQUIRED] The folder that receives the git checkout depending on the name of the variable
# use BRANCH_MASTER="/out" for example, or BRANCH_TESTING="/testout"

PUBLIC_KEY = "" # [REQUIRED] Your mounted public key path inside the container

USER = git # [OPTIONAL] The user used in the git push

IN = "" # [OPTIONAL] The folder that holds the git bare repo
```

## Setup

```bash
$ docker run -d \
    -p 1234:22 \
    --name deploy \
    -e PUBLIC_KEY="/id_rsa.pub" \
    -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/id_rsa.pub \
    -e BRANCH_TRUSTY="/out" \
    -e BRANCH_MASTER="/out" \
    -v /var/www:/out \
    -e IN="/in" \
    pocesar/docker-git-deploy

```

NOTE: You can use `-e PUBLIC_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"` as well and drop the `-v` part of the public key

Check the examples folder with a sample `docker-compose.yml` with a Typescript / Node.js project

## Deploy

```bash
git remote add upstream ssh://docker@yourhost:1234/in # or /home/git/repo.git by default
git commit -m "Behold!"
git push upstream master
```

## Mods

You can inject your bash scripts into the `post-receive` hook by mounting your script to `-v /var/some/script.sh:/userscript`. It can be anything, like set folder / file permissions, execute `npm install`, `bower install` etc. and any type of language (if you install the needed binaries of course).

If you mount a script to `-v /var/www/somescript.sh:/failscript`, in case your `/userscript` fails, this will be called. this is useful to do some cleanup or revert a commit in case of failure. a simple revert command is `git reset --hard HEAD~1`. `/failscript` receive the same arguments that `/userscript` does

You can also use `echo "hello world" >> $MEM_LOG` to output stuff to the docker log from any of your scripts. Be aware that the `/userscript` will be called everytime there's a push.

The setup script, placed in `/setup`, set as `-v /var/some/script.sh:/setup`, it will be called one time when the container starts. Useful to install extra software you may need (like `ruby`, `node`, `jekyll`). Only the DOCKER set environment variables are available inside (like `BRANCH_*`, `MEM_LOG`, `IN`, `USER`, `GIT_DIR`, `HOME`). Eg.:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# this is /setup

apt-get -y -qq install nodejs
wget http://example.com/something.js > "$BRANCH_MASTER/something.js"
echo "something.js downloaded" >> $MEM_LOG # goes to docker logs
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env node

/** this is /userscript
 * it receives the following arguments:
 * $1 = the branch name (as seen in git)
 * $2 = the refname, like ea9da19
 * $3 = the current path of the working dir
 *
 * all environment variables are available inside, including the IN, BRANCH_* and GIT
 */

var
    path = require('path'), fs = require('fs');

# process.argv[1] === branch
# process.argv[2] === gitref
# process.argv[3] === working tree

if (process.argv[1] === 'master') {
    fs.chmodSync(path.join(process.env.BRANCH_MASTER, 'cache'), '0774');
}
```
